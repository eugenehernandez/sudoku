# Sudoku Solver in C

This is a Sudoku solver program written in C, shared on X by Tetsuo.ai. The primary objective of this project was to replicate and test the algorithm for personal learning purposes.

## Overview

The program implements a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. It reads an unsolved Sudoku grid, applies the algorithm, and outputs the solved grid.

## Usage

You can run the program on any C-compatible environment. For testing purposes, you can try different Sudoku puzzles by modifying the input grid in the code.

### Jupyter Notebook Solutions

While my primary solutions are displayed in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook, you are welcome to copy the C code and experiment with it to solve other puzzles.
